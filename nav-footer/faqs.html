            <h4>How to remove the heel?</h4>
            <p>You will be amazed at the fact that sliding the heels and buckle them is so simple and fun! Here's how
                it works</p>
            <h4>Can all heels be mounted on all shoes?</h4>
            <p>Yes! As long as the shoes are in the same size range. ( our heel )</p>
            <h4>Can the shoes not be fitted with a heel?</h4>
            <p>No. However, it is possible to install a low heel that is comfortable to walk.</p>
            <h4>Why can't I make flat shoes?</h4>
            <p>This is currently impossible. Our shoes are arched to add comfort while wearing and we can't abandon this
                arch. However, the shoes can be fitted with a low heel that is suitable for walking and very
                comfortable.</p>
            <h4>Can I press the disassembly button while walking?</h4>
            <p>No. This button is inside the shoe and cannot be activated while walking.</p>
            <h4>Do I feel the button when I walk?</h4>
            <p>Most people won't, but if you can feel it, please contact customer service at
                <em><strong>customer-services@flatandinches.com</strong></em> We will help you solve this problem.
                Usually we recommend
                a
                silicone insole, which is suitable for almost everyone.</p>
            <h4>Is the heel divided?</h4>
            <p>No matter what, we pursue as simple as possible. You can use any heel on any side.</p>

            <h4>Is the arch on the shoe very flexible?</h4>
            <p>No, in fact, the opposite is true. Arched to prevent falls, so no matter what height of heel you choose,
                you
                can stand very steady.</p>
            <h4>Why can't I wear a heel outside the size range?</h4>
            <p>Because each heel height in a range is designed according to the size of the shoe. In fact, in the
                footwear
                industry, the 8 cm heel of the 35th shoe is slightly smaller than the 8 cm heel of the 42nd shoe. In
                order
                for our customers to wear the correct heel height, we have to adhere to this principle.</p>
