        <p>Our shoes are suitable for thousands of women but sometimes each person's feet are unique, which
            makes buying
            shoes of the right size very challenging. We hope that this size reference can alleviate the trouble of
            selecting the code. Please consider the following items when purchasing shoes and heels online.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Please refer to the international shoe size reference table for your size.</li>
            <li> View product information. If we feel that the shoe type will be different from the European standard
                shoe
                size, we will make a special mark in the information section.</li>
            <li> If you still have questions, please<em><strong>customer-services@flatandinches.com</strong></em>contact
                customer service e-mail and ask for advice.</li>
            <li> Some customers tell us that they only wear a specific style. This may be because their special foot
                drives
                them to choose a similar shoe type. In order to minimize the risk of online purchases, it is better to
                stick
                to the shoes you have tried.</li>
            <li>Don't worry! If you choose the wrong size or the size is not suitable, you can always return your shoes.
                As
                long as it meets our return conditions.</li>
