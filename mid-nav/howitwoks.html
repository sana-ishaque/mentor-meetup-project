        <p class="a">Sliding heels off and clipping them on is astonishing, easy and fun! Here is how it works. <br>
            To put a heel on hold it like this and slide it in till you hear a clicking sound. You may have to use a bit
            of force in the beginning to hear the click because let's face it, most of us don’t know that the mechanism
            has been dimensioned to be pressed 5000 times and that you are using a very robust mechanical system. Do
            make sure you hear the click so that you know the heel is safe to walk in!
        </p>
        <img src="hiw/how-it-works.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="Unclip Heels" class="unclip">
        <p class="a">Taking it out is no less simple. Look inside your shoe. You will see a round button near the heel
            in the insole. Simply press deep, very deep into this button and simultaneously slide the heel out. We find
            it’s helpful to use a thumb instead of a finger until you get the hang of it <br>
            If you are really concerned about breaking a long nail don’t worry. You can use the flat part of your thumb
            which is what most of our clients do and if you don’t want to give that a try you can just use a pen
            instead!
